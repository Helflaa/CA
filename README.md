Course assignment for HTML and CSS course for Frontend Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

About:

This project was part of the course assignment, at the end of the HTML and CSS course in the first semester of Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. The design of this project is based on the design I made for the course assignment, at the end of the Design course, during the first semester.

Requirements:

The course assignment had the following requirements:

The HTML should be semantic and neatly formatted.
The CSS should follow the DRY principles and be easy to read-The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. PLease do no use a CSS framework like Bootstrap; we want to see that you can build responsive websites without the use of a framework.
The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
Each page should have a unique <meta name="description">, <title> and <h1>.
You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by yourself, You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, which should be included in your report.

Process:
Commenced by scrutinizing each page and formulating a strategy for organizing it. Opted for extensive usage of nested grids and flex structures, finding them particularly intuitive for ensuring website responsiveness. Implemented alt text for all images to enhance accessibility. Strived to enhance clarity in the presentation of links.
