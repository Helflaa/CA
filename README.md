HTML/CSS Course Assignment

You must deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief you chose in Design 1.
The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief.
Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button using the action attribute.

Process:
Creating the "Rainy Day" webpage involved a straightforward use of HTML and CSS. I began with a basic plan, sketching out a layout, and then organized the webpage step by step.
Exploring colors and fonts, I aimed for a calm yet stylish vibe inspired by a rainy day.
Approach:I utilized tools like Visual Studio Code for structure, ensuring the webpage looked good on various devices. Regular checks were performed to guarantee a smooth shopping experience.
I played the roles of both designer and user, making adjustments for a better overall look and functionality.

Self-Reflection:
Building the webpage was a learning experience. Solving both creative and technical issues felt like an achievement.
From fixing code problems to refining the design, this project showcased growth in attention to detail and improved front-end skills.
